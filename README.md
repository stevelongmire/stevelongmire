- 👋 Hi, I’m @stevelongmire
- 👀 I’m interested in utilizing acoustic telemetry data to better understand how Sciaenops ocellatus move and utilize habitat.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to map spatial telemetry in R and the ideal methods for analysis of telemetry data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interspecies tagging and tracking efforts to understand usage of the Northeast Florida portion of the Intracoastal Waterway.
- 📫 How to reach me stevenlongmire@ufl.edu
